Introduction to Quantum Computing and hybrid HPC-QC systems
===========================================================

Recent developments in quantum technology are bringing the world
closer to a new technological revolution – the advent of usable
quantum computers able to provide enormous acceleration to important
computational tasks. In coming years, quantum computing is expected to
have a huge impact on practically all areas of research that can
utilise computational modelling.

Starting operations in April this year, the NordΙQuEst project brings
together a consortium of seven partners from five Nordic and Baltic
countries to connect world-leading traditional HPC resources and
quantum computers across national borders with the aim to establish a
quantum computing platform customised to the needs of the region.


ENCCS is now joining forces with NordIQuEst to deliver two-day
training workshops covering the fundamentals of quantum computing (QC),
including:

- Introduction to key concepts: quantum states, qubits, quantum algorithms
- QC programming in high-level languages for use cases in
  optimisation, finance and quantum chemistry followed by testing
  quantum programs to esure their correctness
- Overview of the main QC hardware approaches
- Integration of QC with classical computing: hybrid classical/quantum
  algorithms and HPC-QC systems.

   For the hands-on training sessions, basic familiarity with Python
   and some experience working in a Unix environment are desirable. No
   previous experience with quantum computers expected.

# ENCCS/NordIQuEst lesson on Quantum Computing and hybrid HPC-QC systems

ENCCS has joined forces with NordIQuEst to deliver two-day training workshops 
covering the fundamentals of quantum computing (QC), including:

- Introduction to key concepts: quantum states, qubits, quantum algorithms
- QC programming in high-level languages for use cases in optimisation, finance and quantum chemistry followed by testing quantum programs to esure their correctness
- Overview of the main QC hardware approaches
- Integration of QC with classical computing: hybrid classical/quantum algorithms and HPC-QC systems.


### Prerequisites

For the hands-on training sessions, basic familiarity with Python and some experience working in a Unix environment are desirable. 
No previous experience with quantum computers expected.
